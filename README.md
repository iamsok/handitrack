# HandiTrak

HandiTrak is a golf network system, allowing golfers to keep track of their scores and handicap, connect with other golfers and track their status, and search for golf courses. 

As a golf professional, one of the major problems I encounter is golfers not knowing what their actual handicap is. Golfers spend hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars on golf expenses such as greens fees, equipment and lessons, but do not feel the need to spend a few dollars on a handicap system. Creating a free, simple, easy to use app that allows users to both track their own handicap, as well as their buddies will keep the game more pure and accurate.
